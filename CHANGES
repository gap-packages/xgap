 This file describes changes in the GAP package 'XGAP'.
===========================================================================

4.24 (2016-02-28)
  * Package homepage now is on GitHub
  * Add Max Horn as package maintainer, removed maintainer flag from
    Max Neunhöffer
  * Update C code from K&R to ANSI C, fix various warnings
  * Replace uses of obsolete GAP_ROOT_PATHS by GAPInfo.RootPaths

4.23 (2012-04-30)
 * XGAP now reports "4.23" as version number instead of "4.22".

 * Follow Frank Luebeck's suggestions for some startup calls.

 * Fix manual documentation for installation.

4.22 (~2012)
 * XGAP now runs on 64-bit machines, thanks to Nate Eldredge and 
   Max Horn for submitting patches.

 * XGAP now runs with GAP >= 4.5 in addition to GAP 4.4.12.

 * Minor tweak of the help display.

 * Include "Save As XFig" kindly donated by Russ Woodroofe

4.21 (2004-05-22)
 * The handling of pseudo terminals is fixed for newer versions of Linux
   using devfs filesystems. Now functions getpt, grantpt and ptsname_r
   are used in this case.

 * The word "share" in the connection with "package" in the manual has 
   become extinct.

 * Fixed a bug in CompareLevels for graphic subgroup lattices, which came
   into existence because some filters changed in the main library.

4.20 (2004-02-20)
 * Deleted a line in src.x11/selfile.c offending the compiler on Mac OS/X.
   Seems to work under Linux/i386 also.

 * Two changes with respect to pseudo terminals for the Windows/CYGWIN
   environment, suggested by Gary Zablackis. This is not tested.

4.19 (~2003)
 * Fixed behaviour when the small groups library is not around. 

4.18 (2003-05-20)
 * Fix display of help pages (bug reported by Walter Neumann).
   Note that this probably will make this version incompatible with
   GAP 4.2 and earlier versions (not tested).

4.17 (2003-05-17)
 * PackageInfo.g file is now supplied.

 * The new package loading mechanism is therefore supported.

 * A documentation package is generated.

 * The global variable 'last' is set in init.g to make the XGAP package
   autoloadable.

 * Changes in the autoconf usage: All files are now here.
   No more referring to ../../cnf from main GAP.

 * Slight changes in the startup shell script.

 * Display of MBytes instead of KBytes.

4.16 (~2002)
 * Thanks to Greg Gamble the html version of the documentation is now
   up to date and works with the current version of gapmacro.tex and
   convert.pl. There were quite a few small corrections in the manual.

 * There is now a pdf version of the manual included.

4.15 (~2002)
 * Fixed a small bug reported by Herbert Pahlings concerning output
   to encapsulated postscript. This did not work for text objects
   that contained opening brackets.

4.14 (~2002)
 * XGAP compiles on newer X11R6.4, which is included for example in
   Debian/GNU Linux 3.0

4.13 / xgap4r13 (~2000)
 * XGAP now reports "4.13" as version number instead of "4.02".

 * XGAP compiles on X11R6.4, which is included for example in
   Suse Linux 7.0 and RedHat Linux 7.0.

xgap4r12 (~2000)
 * XGAP now reports "4.02" as version number instead of "4.00".
   This was needed for the ITC share package to recognize the changes to
   xgap4r11 (yes!). The reason why it is "4.02" and not "4.12" has a
   complicated reason.


xgap4r11 (~1999)
 * Fix of a small bug in a method installation of the operation `Relabel' for
   a text object.
   Thanks to Volkmar Felsch for reporting this bug.

 * Added support for Hirsch lengths in "infinity" levels of space groups.

 * Corrected handling of "infinity" levels for space groups. They are now
   permuted if this is necessary for new inclusions.

 * Fix of a bug which produced empty levels with space groups.

 * Improved description of the concept of levels in the manual.

 * Improved example of a space group via CRYST in the manual.
 
 * Renaming of the first standard menu of graphic sheets from "Gap" to "Sheet".

 * Renaming of "Gap" to "GAP" in some menus.

 * Fix of some typos in the manual.
