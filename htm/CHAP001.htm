<h1>1 How to read this manual</h1><p>
<p>
This chapter tells you exactly, which part of this manual you have to read
if you want to learn certain things about XGAP.
<p>
If you do not know anything about XGAP you might want to have a look at
chapter <a href="../../xgap/htm/CHAP002.htm">xgap:What is XGAP?</a>. You can learn there, what XGAP is all
about, what you can do with it as a user (doing no programming) and for
what you can use XGAP within your own programs. You find also references
to other sections of this manual to get into the details.
<p>
If you want to know how to install XGAP, then you should look into 
chapter <a href="../../xgap/htm/CHAP003.htm">xgap:Installing XGAP</a>.
<p>
If you know XGAP from its <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>3 version, you will consider chapter
<a href="../../xgap/htm/CHAP010.htm">xgap:Differences to XGAP 3</a> useful. There you can quickly ``update'' your
knowledge to the new <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>4 version and also find some technical details
about the implementation, which is nearly completely new.
<p>
Perhaps you know already, that you can display subgroup lattices
interactively with XGAP and you want to start with this right now. In
this case, jump to chapters <a href="../../xgap/htm/CHAP004.htm">xgap:Subgroup Lattices - Examples</a> and
<a href="../../xgap/htm/CHAP005.htm">xgap:Subgroup Lattices - systematic description</a>
immediately. However, you should make sure first that you have a working
XGAP installed! 
<p>
The XGAP library is described in these and the remaining chapters of this
manual. The information is divided into the following parts:
<p>
<dl compact>
<dt><strong>subgroup lattices - examples</strong> <dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>subgroup lattices - systematic description</strong> <dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>graphic sheets</strong> <dd>
  Creating and managing graphic sheets and graphic objects. This is the
  lowest level.
<p>
<dt><strong>user communication</strong> <dd>
  Handling of menus, dialogs, text selectors and popups.
<p>
<dt><strong>graphic posets</strong> <dd>
  Display of posets in graphic sheets.
<p>
<dt><strong>graphic graphs</strong> <dd>
  Display of mathematical graphs in graphic sheets. A lot of ``routine
  work'' for handling these things is already done and can be used in
  your applications!
</dl>
There is a chapter for each of these parts.
